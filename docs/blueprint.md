## Core Features:

- Contextual Guidance: AI-powered suggestion tool to provide relevant bible verses and talking points based on a given topic. This feature acts as a tool to the user.

- AI Personas: Simulated 'people' with AI-generated images that change for each interaction, showing facial expressions in unique settings. People will become gradually more difficult to convince, using generative AI. There would be a person, with a whole life story, and at a certain point after the gospel is presented a response of belief can be made where the person believes in Jesus Christ for their salvation, which is the objective and then after a farewell another persona is made who might have more difficult questions before they come to believe and so forth.
