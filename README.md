## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 18.x or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Firebase project

### Firebase Setup

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
2.  **Enable Authentication:**
    *   In your Firebase project, go to "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method".
    *   Enable "Email/Password" and "Google" sign-in providers.
    *   For Google Sign-In, ensure a "Project support email" is selected.
3.  **Enable Firestore Database:**
    *   Go to "Firestore Database" -> "Create database".
    *   Choose your region and start in **Production mode**.
    *   Update the **Rules** with the content from `firestore.rules` in this project (or similar secure rules).
4.  **Enable Firebase Storage:**
    *   Go to "Storage" -> "Get started".
    *   Complete the setup.
    *   Update the **Rules** with the content from `storage.rules` in this project (or similar secure rules).
5.  **Get Firebase Configuration:**
    *   In your Firebase project settings (Project Overview -> Project settings -> General tab), find your web app's configuration (SDK setup and configuration).
6.  **Create `.env.local` file:**
    *   In the root of this project, create a file named `.env.local`.
    *   Copy the following content into it and replace the placeholders with your actual Firebase project credentials:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
    ```

### Installation and Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the Genkit development server (for AI flows):**
    Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or
    # npm run genkit:watch (if you want it to watch for changes in AI flows)
    ```
    Ensure Genkit starts successfully and discovers your flows.
4.  **Run the Next.js development server:**
    In another terminal window/tab, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or your configured port) in your browser to see the application.

## Available Scripts
